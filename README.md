# Tilix Theme(s)
Everyone have a different taste, not only we want app that can run and meet our requirement but we also love the eye candy thingy....if you using [Tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix) (previously known as Terminix) and looking for other theme which are not shipped by default, consider your're lucky because this repo have a huge collection of themes which I gather from the net and ported to use with Tilix + 1 extra theme that I made especially for Tilix Terminal....[Terminix Dark](https://github.com/storm119/Tilix-Themes/blob/master/Themes/terminix-dark.json) and NOT forget to mention from the contributors by submitting the new themes dedicated to Tilix community.

### Notes:
* 1: Related to this discussion [#380](https://github.com/gnunn1/terminix/issues/380)
* 2: I'm using Tilix + [Linux Mint 18.2 Sonya (Cinnamon)](https://www.linuxmint.com/) + [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) + [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) + other plugins.



### How to use:
* You need to install from [Tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix) or [Tilix Website](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/) to use my theme and the ported themes or from one that provided by the other contributors. Other terminal wont work...
* Pick the one you like and Copy the theme *.json to...
```
~/.config/tilix/schemes/
```
* OR tap the ["Preview available themes"](Themes.md) and pick the one you like and copy/paste the commands below the SS to Tilix Terminal...ie (for Terminix Dark)
```
wget -qO $HOME"/.config/tilix/schemes/terminix-dark.json" https://git.io/v7QaK
```
* And finally apply via Tilix
```
Preferences/Default/Color/Color scheme
```


### Uninstall:
* Just delete the theme *.json...you're good to go!


### Screenshot:
* You can also ["Preview available themes"](Themes.md) before installing...(huge thanks to [EliverLara](https://github.com/EliverLara) for the screenies)
